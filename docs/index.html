<h1>Gath Drawer</h1>
<p>
    And David took to heart these words, and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
    And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands,
    and scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
    (1 Samuel 21:12-13)
